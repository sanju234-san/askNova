AskNova AI Chat Assistant
AskNova is an AI-powered chat assistant that leverages IBM Watson's Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies. This interactive web application provides an engaging user experience by enabling users to chat with an AI assistant, which responds with text and converts the text to speech in real-time. The application adjusts its responses based on the sentiment of the user's input, providing a more personalized interaction.

Key Features:
Natural Language Understanding: AskNova uses IBM Watson Assistant to understand and respond to user inputs in natural language.

Sentiment Analysis: The assistant analyzes the sentiment of the user's message using TextBlob, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. Based on the sentiment, the tone and voice of the assistant's response are adjusted.

Text-to-Speech: The assistant's response is converted into speech using IBM Watson Text-to-Speech, allowing users to listen to the response in real-time.

Interactive Interface: The application is built using Streamlit, providing a simple and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the assistant.

Tech Stack:
IBM Watson Assistant API: Used to generate intelligent responses based on user input.

IBM Watson Text-to-Speech API: Converts text responses into human-like speech.

TextBlob: A Python library used for performing sentiment analysis on user input.

Streamlit: A Python framework for creating interactive web applications.

Python: The main programming language used for backend development.

How It Works:
User Input: The user types a message into the input field.

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of the message is analyzed to determine whether the tone is positive, negative, or neutral.

Response Generation: Based on the sentiment, the assistant generates an appropriate response using IBM Watson Assistant.

Text-to-Speech: The generated response is converted into speech using IBM Watsonâ€™s TTS service and played for the user.

Tone Customization: Users can choose from various response tones, including "Cheerful", "Excited", "Calm", "Sarcastic", "Neutral", and "Empathetic", to personalize the interaction further.
